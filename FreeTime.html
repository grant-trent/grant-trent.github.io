  Overall, I'm a pretty simple guy. I enjoy the little things in life. Spending time with friends, watching football, and fishing is how I spend my free time. Here is a list of my favorite TV shows.

            <li>Avatar: The Last Airbender</li>
            <li>Arrow</li>
            <li>Community</li>
            <li>Parks and Rec</li>
