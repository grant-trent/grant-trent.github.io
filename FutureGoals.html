Hopefully I have a decent job that pays well and that I enjoy. As long as I have enough money to comfortably get by I will be happy. 
I don't really need a ton of money to be satisfied.

After I graduate college, I would like to be able to keep up with most of my hobbies that I do right now. When I start a full-time job, 
I hope I don't lose too much time to where I can't do the things I enjoy.
