 Overall, my pre-high school days were pretty good. 
Growing up I would go to the lake with my dad and grandpa, I played baseball, and I also enjoyed staying up late playing video games with friends. 
I was an average little kid. I went to a very small elementary school with about 25 kids in my class. Everyone knew everybody which was neat in its own little way.
When I was 13, the baseball team I was on won state and got to go to regionals in Minnesota. We ended up placing next to last, but it was still one of the best times of my life.
